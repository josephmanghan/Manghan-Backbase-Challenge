# Joseph Manghan - Backbase Coding Challenge

*Manghan-Backbase-Challenge.js* automatically transfers funds from a customer's savings account to their current account if an overdraft is in use and if funds are available. 

## About

The goal of the challenge is to save customers money by minimising their overdraft fees. 

The script receives data from an input CSV file containing a ledger of transactions. It processes this data, making automatic transferrals where possible at the end of each day. Finally, it produces a new CSV file containing both the input and amendment ledger entries.
